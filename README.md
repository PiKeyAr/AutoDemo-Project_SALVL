# AutoDemo Windy Valley Project for SALVL
This is a fork of [ItsEasyActually's Autodemo SADXLVL2 project](https://github.com/ItsEasyActually/AutoDemo-Project_SADXLVL2) to make it work with the latest version of [SA Tools](https://github.com/X-Hax/sa_tools).

This package is based on the [Autodemo Windy Valley mod](https://github.com/ItsEasyActually/AutoDemo_WindyValley), which adds the following improvements:
- Recreated level textures, object textures and models that were missing in the Autodemo
- Edited landtables for better compatibility with the PC version of SADX
- Act 2 is now a landtable that can be loaded in SALVL
- Custom SET files from the mod
- Extra objects added in the mod
- Skybox definitions

To add Beta Windy Valley to your mod project, do the following:
1. Make a new PC - SADX project in [SA Tools Hub](https://github.com/X-Hax/sa_tools/wiki/SA-Tools-Hub#creating-a-project).
2. Click [Code - Download ZIP](https://github.com/X-Hax/AutoDemo-Project_SALVL/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) to download the package.
2. Extract the contents of the `AutodemoPCProject` folder in the ZIP file to the project folder (overwrite any existing files).
3. Open the project in [SALVL](https://github.com/X-Hax/sa_tools/wiki/SALVL) like usual and you will be able to explore Beta Windy Valley.

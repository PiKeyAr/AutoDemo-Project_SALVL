# AutoDemo Windy Valley Project for SALVL
This is a fork of [ItsEasyActually's Autodemo SADXLVL2 project](https://github.com/ItsEasyActually/AutoDemo-Project_SADXLVL2) to make it work with the latest version of [SA Tools](https://github.com/X-Hax/sa_tools).

To install the Autodemo project, do the following:
1. Make a new Dreamcast - SA1 Autodemo project in SA Tools Hub.
2. Extract the contents of this fork to the project folder (overwrite any existing files).
3. Open the project in SALVL like usual and you will be able to explore Beta Windy Valley.

# AutoDemo Windy Valley Project for SALVL
This is a fork of [ItsEasyActually's Autodemo SADXLVL2 project](https://github.com/ItsEasyActually/AutoDemo-Project_SADXLVL2) to make it work with the latest version of [SA Tools](https://github.com/X-Hax/sa_tools).

Although SA Tools can create an Autodemo project and you can open Windy Valley in it, this package adds some improvements:
- Recreated level textures, object textures and custom models from the Autodemo Windy Valley mod
- Act 2 is now a landtable that can be loaded in SALVL
- SET files from the Autodemo Windy Valley mod

To install the Autodemo project, do the following:
1. Click Code - Download ZIP.
1. Make a new Dreamcast - SA1 Autodemo project in SA Tools Hub.
2. Extract the contents of the folder `AutodemoProject` in the ZIP file to the project folder (overwrite any existing files).
3. Open the project in SALVL like usual and you will be able to explore Beta Windy Valley.
